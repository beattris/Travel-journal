## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹
This is a solo project given by Bob Ziroll to get our hands dirty on using props and javascript methods to populate the details of a component. In this project, we had to get data from a JSON file `data.js`, then with the use of props and .map(), the data was used to display the travel details!
## How To Run? ðŸ¤”
Download this code either as a `zip file` or use the `git clone` command to clone it.
Then, open the project folder in your editor and on the integrated terminal:

After the installation,

    That's all you'd need to do ðŸ™‚
